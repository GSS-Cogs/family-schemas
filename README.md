# Family Schemas

This repository currently contains JSON schemas representing the structure
of JSON files used in a family of dataset transformations.

`pipelines-schema.json`: details the properties used across a dataset family
and lists the transformation pipelines.

`dataset-schema.json`: one for each transformation pipeline, providing properties
required for each of the extract, transform and load stages of a pipeline.
